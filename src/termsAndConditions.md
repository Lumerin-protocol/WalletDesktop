These terms govern the use of the Site and apply to all visitors to the Site and those who use the Digital Asset Wallet software that is downloadable from the Site (the "Wallet" or "Software"), as well as other services and resources controlled by Titan that are available or enabled via the Site, (each a "Service" and collectively, the "Services" which term includes the Software and the Site unless explicitly set forth below). Importantly, as discussed in Section 1.5 below, these terms do not govern any interactions you may have with our third-party API providers, each of which has its own terms.

By clicking on the "I Accept" button, completing the registration process, downloading the Software and/or browsing the Site, you represent that (1) you have read, understand and agree to be bound by the terms, (2) you are of legal age to form a binding contract with Titan, and (3) you have the authority to enter into the terms personally or on behalf of the legal entity for which you are using the Services. The term "you" refers to you individually or the legal entity on whose behalf the Services are used, as applicable. If you do not agree to be bound by the Terms, you many not access or use the Services. Titan may modify these Terms at any time in our sole discretion. If we do so, we will post revised terms on the Site and we will change the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of these Terms. Such revised Terms as so posted will take effect immediately.

DECISIONS TO ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS OR PERFORM OPERATIONS INVOLVING DIGITAL ASSETS SHOULD BE TAKEN SOLELY ON YOUR OWN ACCORD.

## 1. Use of the Services.

The Software, the Site, the Services, and the information and content available therein (“Lumerin Content”) are protected worldwide by copyright laws. Subject to the Terms, Titan grants you a limited license to reproduce portions of Lumerin Content solely as required to use the Services for your personal or internal business purposes. Unless otherwise specified by Titan in a separate license, your right to use any Lumerin Content is subject to these Terms.

You will not have an account with Titan. You also will not give us any of your assets, and your tokens and coins are not stored with us. All assets are on the blockchain itself, and we do not control them. No data leaves your computer or your browser. The Wallet does not collect or hold your keys or information, and the Wallet cannot access accounts; recover keys, passwords, or other information; reset passwords; or reverse transactions. You are solely responsible for your use of the Wallet, including without limitation for storing, backing-up, and maintaining the confidentiality of your keys, passwords, and information, and for the security of any transactions you perform using the Wallet. You expressly relieve and release Titan from any and all liability and/or loss arising from your use of the Wallet and the Services.

**The Wallet is a non-custodial wallet software, for digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and virtual commodities (“Digital Assets”), meaning you are solely in control of and responsible for your Digital Assets and private keys, and accordingly you can authorize transactions from your wallet address.

## 8. Term and Termination.

### 8.2 Termination by Titan

## 9. Dispute Resolution.

Please read this Section 9 (the “Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It requires you to arbitrate disputes with Titan and limits the manner in which you can seek relief.

### 9.1 Applicability of Arbitration.

You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Site, Services, or Wallet, or to any aspect of your relationship with Titan, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or Titan may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement will apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.

IF YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATION WITH TITAN, YOU ARE AGREEING IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN OR SEEK TO RECOVER MONETARY OR OTHER RELIEF IN ANY LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST TITAN ALLEGING CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS ON YOUR BEHALF. INSTEAD, YOU MAY BRING YOUR CLAIMS AGAINST TITAN SOLELY IN AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION PROCEEDING. IF SUCCESSFUL ON SUCH CLAIMS, YOU COULD BE AWARDED MONEY OR OTHER RELIEF BY AN ARBITRATOR. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING WHETHER TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS, INCLUDING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.

### 9.2 Arbitration Rules and Forum.

The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent (Titan Industries (Global) Co. LTD., Floor 4, Banco Popular Building, Road Town, Tortola VG1110, British Virgin Islands). The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under \$250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, will be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at [http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration](http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/); all other claims will be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at [http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/](http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/). JAMS’s rules are also available at [http://www.jamsadr.com/](http://www.jamsadr.com/) or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in New Castle County, Delaware. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. All arbitration pleadings and proceedings will be conducted in English.

### 9.3 Authority of Arbitrator.

The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency will have exclusive authority to: (a) Determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement; and (b) Resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Titan. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.

### 9.4 Waiver of Jury Trial.

YOU AND TITAN HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.

You and Titan are instead electing that all claims and disputes will be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 9.1 above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.

### 9.5 Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.

ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATE WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (a) representative action for public injunctive relief may be arbitrated on a class basis and (b) in the event that the foregoing sentence is deemed invalid or unenforceable with respect to a particular class or dispute for recovery of damages, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration and instead claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 10.5.

### 9.6 30-Day Right to Opt Out.

You have the right to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: [Floor 4, Banco Popular Building, Road Town, Tortola VG1110, British Virgin Islands], within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Notice must include your name and address and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of the Terms will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.

### 9.7 Severability.

If any part of this Arbitration Agreement is found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such part will be of no force and effect and will be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement will continue in full force and effect.

### 9.8 Survival of Agreement.

This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Titan.

### 9.9 Modification.

Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Titan makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will not apply to any individual claim(s) that you had already provided notice of to Titan.

## 10. Acknowledgement of Risk.

**10.1** An encrypted backup of certain information associated with your wallet can be stored on eligible devices. The private key is associated with the wallet address and, together, they can be used to authorize the transfer of Digital Assets to and from that wallet address. You are solely responsible for the retention and security of your private key and any mnemonic phrase (“Secret Phrase”) associated with your wallet. You must keep your wallet address, Secret Phrase, and private key access information secure. It is very important that you backup your private keys, backup phrases or passwords. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of Digital Assets associated with your wallet. You acknowledge and agree that we do not receive or store your wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted private key, or Secret Phrase associated with your wallet. We cannot generate a new password for your wallet if you fail to remember your original password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any wallet address and private key pairs maintained in your wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any Digital Assets you have associated with such wallet address will become inaccessible. Accordingly, we shall have no responsibility or liability whatsoever in the event you are unable to access your wallet for any reason including without limitation your failure to keep your wallet address, Secret Phrase and private key information secure.

**10.2** You acknowledge and agree that: (i) Titan is not responsible for your access or use of any services provided by third-party API service providers and shall have no liability whatsoever in connection with your use of such services, including, without limitation, any transactions you dispute; (ii) the limits of amounts that you may exchange via any such third party API service providers per day shall be subject to any requirements of the third-party developed Smart Contracts; and iii) blockchain operations are irrevocable meaning when you conduct any transactions via any third party API service providers, you shall be solely responsible for the consequences of any issues associated with such transactions, including, without limitation, your transfer to an incorrect address or problems associated with the node servers selected by you.

**10.3** In order for all proposed Digital Asset transactions to be completed, they must be confirmed and recorded in the Digital Asset’s associated public blockchain. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third parties, which we do not own, control, or operate. We have no control over the blockchain networks and, therefore, cannot and do not ensure that any transaction details that you submit via our Services will be confirmed and processed. By using the Wallet, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) we do not have the ability to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction; (ii) the transaction details you submit may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the applicable blockchain networks; (iii) we do not store, send, or receive Digital Assets; and (iv) any transfer that occurs in relation to any Digital Asset occurs on the relevant blockchain network and not on a network owned by us and therefore we do not guarantee the transfer of title or right in any Digital Asset.

**10.4** You acknowledge and agree that you shall assume all risks related to the use of the Services and you shall be solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your private key. You understand and acknowledge that private keys may be compromised if customers choose to store their private keys in non-secure systems, such as third-party email services, which may be susceptible to security breaches and security incidents, despite our efforts to discourage our customers from engaging in these practices. Although such incidents are outside of our control and do not relate to any insecurity or vulnerability on the part of the Lumerin Site, customers may nevertheless blame or become dissatisfied with the Lumerin Site as a result of these negative experiences.

**10.5** You accept and acknowledge that we are not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any Digital Asset transaction initiated via the Services. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction details carefully before attempting to transfer a Digital Asset.

**10.6** Use of the Services or the Wallet may carry financial risk. Digital Assets are a novel and relatively experimental technology. Their value, if any, can fluctuate with great volatility, and transactions conducted with Digital Assets are irreversible. Digital Assets and smart contracts are typically described using extremely technical language that is difficult to understand and requires a deep knowledge of cryptography and computer science. Functionality made available on the Website, in the Services or the Wallet may have inherent design flaws that have not been detected in testing or may not perform as expected in conjunction with third-party technology or high-volume use. There are additional risks that exist with respect to the use of interacting with technologies like the Services or the Wallet, such as the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. Please be aware that hacks, cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service or errors, double- spent attacks, flash-loan attacks, vulnerabilities, defects or flaws in the applicable third-party blockchain network, or other events that are beyond our control may lead to partial or complete theft or loss of Digital Assets.
