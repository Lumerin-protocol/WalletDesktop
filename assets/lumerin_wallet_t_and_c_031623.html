Subject to the Terms, Titan grants you a limited license to reproduce portions of Lumerin Content solely as required to use the Services for your personal or internal business purposes. Unless otherwise specified by Titan in a separate license, your right to use any Lumerin Content is subject to these Terms. Titan is not a bank or financial institution and does not provide investment or financial advice, or consulting services to users of the Services. We are solely the provider of the Services. You will not have an account with Titan. You also will not give us any of your assets, and your tokens and coins are not stored with us. All assets are on the blockchain itself, and we do not control them. No data leaves your computer or your browser. The Wallet does not collect or hold your keys or information, and the Wallet cannot access accounts; recover keys, passwords, or other information; reset passwords; or reverse transactions. You are solely responsible for your use of the Wallet, including without limitation for storing, backing-up, and maintaining the confidentiality of your keys, passwords, and information, and for the security of any transactions you perform using the Wallet. You expressly relieve and release Titan from any and all liability and/or loss arising from your use of the Wallet and the Services. <b>The Wallet is a non-custodial wallet software, for digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and virtual commodities (“Digital Assets”), meaning you are solely in control of and responsible for your Digital Assets and private keys, and accordingly you can authorize transactions from your wallet address. You expressly acknowledge and agree that as the Wallet is a non-custodial wallet software, you are solely responsible for your activity and any risk of loss at all times.</b>

                            Use of the Software is governed by these Terms. Titan delivers the Wallet via download and Titan will not provide you with any tangible copy of the Wallet. Subject to your compliance with the Terms, Titan grants you a nonassignable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, and non-exclusive license to use the Wallet on computers you own or control solely for your personal or internal business purposes. Because the Wallet is locally installed, you are responsible for the security of the device on which it is installed, including ensuring that you keep anti-virus software for the Wallet current and otherwise protect the device on which the Wallet is installed against malware. Titan is not responsible for any loss or damages – including loss of funds or lockout from accounts accessed via the Wallet – resulting from your failure to keep the device on which the Wallet is installed safe and free of any malware. Titan cannot recover passwords or unlock account information stored on the Wallet in any circumstances, including if the Wallet is compromised by malware on your computer, and it is your sole responsibility to take all reasonable precautions to secure and backup your copy of the Wallet and the information stored on it.

You acknowledge and agree that we do not receive or store your wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted private key, or Secret Phrase associated with your wallet. We cannot generate a new password for your wallet if you fail to remember your original password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any wallet address and private key pairs maintained in your wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any Digital Assets you have associated with such wallet address will become inaccessible. Accordingly, we shall have no responsibility or liability whatsoever in the event you are unable to access your wallet for any reason including without limitation your failure to keep your wallet address, Secret Phrase and private key information secure.</p></li><li data-list-text="10.2."><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: justify;">You acknowledge and agree that: (i) Titan is not responsible for your access or use of any services provided by third-party API service providers and shall have no liability whatsoever in connection with your use of such services, including, without limitation, any transactions you dispute; (ii) the limits of amounts that you may exchange via any such third party API service providers per day shall be subject to any requirements of the third-party developed Smart Contracts; and iii) blockchain operations are irrevocable meaning when you conduct any transactions via any third party API service providers, you shall be solely responsible for the consequences of any issues associated with such transactions, including, without limitation, your transfer to an incorrect address or problems associated with the node servers selected by you.</p></li><li data-list-text="10.3."><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">In order for all proposed Digital Asset transactions to be completed, they must be confirmed and recorded in the Digital Asset’s associated public blockchain. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third parties, which we do not own, control, or operate. We have no control over the blockchain networks and, therefore, cannot and do not ensure that any transaction details that you submit via our Services will be confirmed and processed.

You understand and acknowledge that private keys may be compromised if customers choose to store their private keys in non-secure systems, such as third-party email services, which may be susceptible to security breaches and security incidents, despite our efforts to discourage our customers from engaging in these practices. Although such incidents are outside of our control and do not relate to any insecurity or vulnerability on the part of the Lumerin Site, customers may nevertheless blame or become dissatisfied with the Lumerin Site as a result of these negative experiences.</p></li><li data-list-text="10.5."><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: justify;">You accept and acknowledge that we are not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any Digital Asset transaction initiated via the Services.

Digital Assets are a novel and relatively experimental technology. Their value, if any, can fluctuate with great volatility, and transactions conducted with Digital Assets are irreversible. Digital Assets and smart contracts are typically described using extremely technical language that is difficult to understand and requires a deep knowledge of cryptography and computer science. Functionality made available on the Website, in the Services or the Wallet may have inherent design flaws that have not been detected in testing or may not perform as expected in conjunction with third-party technology or high-volume use. There are additional risks that exist with respect to the use of interacting with technologies like the Services or the Wallet, such as the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. Please be aware that hacks, cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service or errors, double- spent attacks, flash-loan attacks, vulnerabilities, defects or flaws in the applicable third-party blockchain network, or other events that are beyond our control may lead to partial or complete theft or loss of Digital Assets.

You should carefully consider whether you have sufficient understanding of the technology before accessing or using the Services or the Wallet. Further, the legal and regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, Digital Assets, etc. is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the Services or the Wallet and the potential value or utility of Digital Assets. These technologies</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 138%;text-align: justify;">and platforms may have unique benefits, limitations, advantages and disadvantages. It is up to you to understand these factors.</p></li><li data-list-text="10.7."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">By accessing or using the Services or the Wallet, you hereby represent that you have the requisite knowledge and experience to evaluate the risk of the technology you are using and any transactions you undertake, and you accept the risk that the Services or the Wallet might not function as anticipated and that you might lose access to your Digital Assets temporarily or permanently.</p></li><li data-list-text="10.8."><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: justify;">You acknowledge the importance of the security measures we put in place with regards to purchases, payment methods, and financial accounts, and agree to comply with them.
